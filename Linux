1. what is linux. 
It's a open source operating system. it has kernel. ubutu, centos, rhel, debian

2. differentiable bwtween linux and unix- before linix unix was using by everyone. 

3. system hierarchy in linux. 
it has a tree strcture, file and directories. /root, /bin, /home, /etc, /tmp

4. shall in lunix
shell using to execute the commands, bash, zsh, tcsh, this is way to interract with system. 

5. how do you find files in linux. what is grep
file used to find the files, grep used to find the patteren like, searing specific word in different files.

6. difference between soft link and hard link,
softlink is a symbolic link ( short cut for creating file) which pointer to another file or directory.
hardlink - it directly point to inode.

7. How do we manager service in linux?
systemctl, service, checkconfig or sysvinit based commands. 

8. what is ssh - secure shell protocol to connect securly to remote machines from local machine. once login we can excute commands perform actions scurly

9. package manager is a tool to install to instal package - yum reddhat and centos, apt ubutnu or debian. 

10. kernel linux- it importent core compnent of a system, it act as interface between os and hardware. 

11. how to archiveve, tar, gzip

Adavaced linux - 

1. difference between process and a tread?
process is a independent program like java, apache, tread smaller unit with in th eprocess share the shared memory alloted for the process. 

2. strace commadn used for debugging?
debugging, which system calls the porgram doing. in what order it making what are the values?. we can see where it failing

3. Cgroups and control gorups commands in linux.
cgroup is a linux kernel feature that limits accounts for isolating usage.(CPU, memory, disk), depending in container we are running it automatically assign the resources

4. SELinux enhace security
it provides machanism for access scontrol of secuirty. it uses mandatory access control. it limits the scope of process. 

5. how do you manage kernel modules in linux?
using commands like - modprobe to add or remove module  -    lsmod - list currently loaded module
configuration file /etc/modprobe.d can also be used to manage modules.

6. purpose of /proc - if we want access process and kernal information /proc or pseudo will prvide the machanisum. it contains virtual files that has system info, cpu and memory info

7. How to optimize the purformence of a linux system?
performence can be optimized by tuning kernel parameter(sysctl), managing resource usage with groups, optimizing i/o schduling
utilizing performence moniting tools like top, htop.

8. hard-real time - complete given task in strickt time constraints

9.iptables and commands - has a set of rules for allowing and denying the traffic which comes to the machine.

10. what is namespace in linux? - name space is the feature of linux kernel such as  process id and network interface and file system. They are fundamental for containers technologies 
allowing each container to have own isolated environment. 

11. concept of load avarg in linux ? - averg of no.of process which are running or uninteruptable state. it usallu displaced in 

12. Nice command - it control scheduling prority process. default prority is 0, higher priority has (lower nice value), menas zero has higher priority.

13. systemd is a system manager for linux os. it manages system services like initializing restarting, dependency management and service monitoring.

14. Swap file crete in linux? create empty file with dd -if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs-IM count-1024
set correct permission with chomd, settup swap space with mkswap/swapfile. enable swapfile with swapon/swapfile
add it to /etc/fstab to make persistent across reboots. 

15. ext4, xfs - ext4 - known for its simplysity and robustness. it supports large files and volumes nad journeling and defragmentation.
xfs - high performance, scalable and handling large file efficiently. 

Senario based linux 

ðŸ”¹ Question 1: You need to find out why a server is running slowly. What steps would you take? 
checking overall load - top / htop. identify any process using high cpu. 
iostst and iotop for disk i/o, free -m for memeory and df -h for disk. 
netstst or ss command to check any network issue like port blocking.
ping and traceroot for packet delay. 
finally also review /var/log/syslogs or messages for kernel errors

ðŸ”¹ Question 2: A user's home directory is filling up disk space on the root partition. How would you resolve this?
first we can check disk space usage of user -> du -sh /home/user to identify large file and directories.
if possible move to larger file or partion to another partion which are available, using mv or sync command
alternativly we can adive user to archieve the large files using ( tar,gzip)


ðŸ”¹ Question 3: You need to secure a web server against common vulnerabilities. What measures would you take?
software should be uptodate (apt-yum)
also use firewall using iptable or firwalld, REMOVE unnecessary services, default ports which are passing.
Implement HTTPS using TLS/SSL certifications WAF we can enforce

ðŸ”¹ Question 4: The SSH service on your server is being targeted by brute force attacks. What steps would you take to mitigate this?
we can change port 22 to less commantly used in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
implement key based authentication. 
only allow specific ip to connect 

ðŸ”¹ Question 5: You need to automate backups of a directory to a remote server. How would you do it?
rsync for efficient file transfter. ste up ssh key based authentication between local nad remote servers. 
wrote a script to run rsync with the desired optiond and schdule it using cron by adding a crontab -e. 

ðŸ”¹ Question 6: A critical service has crashed and won't restart. What steps do you take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue?
systemctl status servicename and journalctl -u servername
check for configuration errors and missing dependencies.
verify the figuration file syntax, nginx -t and napachctl

ðŸ”¹ Question 7: Your server's time is out of sync, causing issues with applications. How do you fix this?
install and configure ntpd or chrony to sysnc time. check status with stpd -p
ensure correct time zone using command timedatectl

ðŸ”¹ Question 8: You need to create a new user and ensure they have no shell access. How would you do this?
user adduser command with the -s option to set user shall to /sbin/nologin or /bin/false
example : useradd -s /sbin/nologin username.

ðŸ”¹ Question 9: Your server is running out of memory and starting to swap heavily. What actions would you take?
ps aux --sort=-%mem, top, stop and restart process. then increage swap space or create new swap file. 
optimizxe menmory or add new memory.

ðŸ”¹ Question 10: You need to restrict a userâ€™s disk usage. How would you implement this?
we can use disk quotas, first enable disk quotas on the file system by modifying /etc/fastab and remount the file system. 
then use edquota to set user-specific disk quotass and quotaon to enable quotas. check usage with quota.

ðŸ”¹ Question 11: A service needs to start on boot. How do you ensure this?
enable systemctl enable servicename. it creat symlink  for service to start on boot. 
verify with systemctl is-enabled servicename.

ðŸ”¹ Question 12: Your web server is showing a 502 Bad Gateway error. What steps do you take to troubleshoot?


ðŸ”¹ Question 13: You need to schedule a recurring task to clean temporary files. How would you do this?


ðŸ”¹ Question 14: You need to compile and install software from source. What steps do you follow?


ðŸ”¹ Question 15: You need to find and kill all processes started by a specific user. How do you do this?
