1. difference between process and a tread?

2. strace commadn used for debugging?
debugging, which system calls the porgram doing. in what order it making what are the values?. we can see where it failing

3. Cgroups and control gorups commands in linux.
cgroup is a linux kernel feature that limits accounts for isolating usage.(CPU, memory, disk), depending in container we are running it automatically assign the resources

4. SELinux enhace security
it provides machanism for access scontrol of secuirty. it uses mandatory access control. it limits the scope of process. 

5. how do you manage kernel modules in linux?
using commands like - modprobe to add or remove module  -    lsmod - list currently loaded module
configuration file /etc/modprobe.d can also be used to manage modules.

6. purpose of /proc - if we want access process and kernal information /proc or pseudo will prvide the machanisum. it contains virtual files that has system info, cpu and memory info

7. How to optimize the purformence of a linux system?
performence can be optimized by tuning kernel parameter(sysctl), managing resource usage with groups, optimizing i/o schduling
utilizing performence moniting tools like top, htop.

8. hard-real time - complete given task in strickt time constraints

9.iptables and commands - has a set of rules for allowing and denying the traffic which comes to the machine.

10. what is namespace in linux? - name space is the feature of linux kernel such as  process id and network interface and file system. They are fundamental for containers technologies

11. concept of load avarg in linux ? - averg of no.of process which are running or uninteruptable state. it usallu displaced in 

12. Nice command - it control scheduling prority process. default prority is 0, higher priority has (lower nice value), menas zero has higher priority.

13. systemd is a system manager for linux os. it manages system services like initializing restarting, dependency management and service monitoring.

14. Swap file crete in linux? create empty file with dd -if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs-IM count-1024
set correct permission with chomd, settup swap space with mkswap/swapfile. enable swapfile with swapon/swapfile
add it to /etc/fstab to make persistent across reboots. 

15. ext4, xfs - ext4 - known for its simplysity and robustness. it supports large files and volumes nad journeling and defragmentation.
xfs - high performance, scalable and handling large file efficiently. 

Senario based linux
