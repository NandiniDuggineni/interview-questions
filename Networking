Basic Network Interview Questions

1. What is a computer network?
A computer network is a collection of two or more computers and other devices that are connected together to share resources, exchange data, 
and communicate with each other. These connections can be made using physical cables (like Ethernet) or wireless technologies (like Wi-Fi).
Key points:
Purpose: To enable communication and resource sharing (like files, printers, internet access).
Types: Can be small (like a home network) or large (like the internet).
Components: Includes computers, routers, switches, servers, and other devices.
Communication: Data is sent in the form of packets using agreed protocols (e.g., TCP/IP).

2. What are the different types of networks? (LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN)
Local Area Network (LAN)
Covers a small geographic area like a home, office, or building.
Usually connected with Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi.
Example: Your home Wi-Fi network connecting your laptop, phone, and printer.

Wide Area Network (WAN)
Spans large geographic areas, like cities, countries, or even globally.
The internet is the largest example of a WAN.
WANs often use leased telecommunication lines or satellite links.

Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) - Larger than LAN but smaller than WAN.
Covers a city or campus. Often used by organizations with multiple buildings in a city.

Personal Area Network (PAN)
Very small network around a person.
Usually involves devices like smartphones, Bluetooth headphones, and laptops connected via Bluetooth or USB.

Wireless Networks (Wi-Fi)
Devices connect without cables.
Common in homes, cafes, and public spaces.
Uses radio waves to transmit data.

3. What is an IP address?
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical label assigned to every device connected to a computer network 
that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?

What is a subnet mask?

What is a MAC address?

What is DNS and how does it work?

What is DHCP?

What is the difference between TCP and UDP?

What are the OSI and TCP/IP models?

What are common network devices? (Router, Switch, Hub, Gateway)

What is NAT (Network Address Translation)?

What is a firewall?

What is the difference between a hub, switch, and router?

What are some common network topologies?

What is QoS (Quality of Service)?

Explain Load Balancing and how it works.

What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption in networks?

What is the difference between unicast, multicast, and broadcast?

Advanced Network Interview Questions

Sure! Here are some scenario-based network interview questions that test your practical understanding of networking concepts and troubleshooting skills. These kinds of questions are common because they show how you apply knowledge to real-world problems.

Scenario-Based Network Interview Questions
You notice that users are complaining about slow internet access, but internal network applications are working fine. How would you troubleshoot this?

A server in your data center cannot be reached from the internet, but internal users can access it without issues. What steps would you take to diagnose and fix the problem?

Two remote offices are connected over a VPN, but users in one office cannot access shared resources in the other. What could be the reasons and how would you resolve it?

You receive reports that a critical application is intermittently losing connectivity. How would you approach troubleshooting this intermittent network issue?

During a routine check, you find that a switch port is receiving a lot of broadcast traffic, causing network congestion. What could be causing this, and how would you address it?

You have been asked to segment the network to improve security and reduce broadcast traffic. How would you design and implement this using VLANs?

A new device is connected to the network but it cannot get an IP address from the DHCP server. What could be the problem and how would you troubleshoot it?

Your company wants to set up a disaster recovery site with real-time replication. What kind of network setup would you recommend to ensure minimal downtime and data loss?

You observe that there is a sudden spike in network traffic coming from one host. How would you investigate and mitigate any potential security threat?

After configuring a new router, users in one subnet cannot reach the internet, but users in another subnet can. What could be wrong with your router configuration?

You are tasked with improving network performance for video conferencing. What network settings or configurations would you consider adjusting?

There is a problem with DNS resolution causing delays in accessing websites. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this?

Would you like me to provide detailed example answers for any of these scenarios? Or help you with how to structure your response in interviews?
