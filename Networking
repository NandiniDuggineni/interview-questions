Basic Network Interview Questions

1. What is a computer network?
A computer network is a collection of two or more computers and other devices that are connected together to share resources, exchange data, 
and communicate with each other. These connections can be made using physical cables (like Ethernet) or wireless technologies (like Wi-Fi).
Key points:
Purpose: To enable communication and resource sharing (like files, printers, internet access).
Types: Can be small (like a home network) or large (like the internet).
Components: Includes computers, routers, switches, servers, and other devices.
Communication: Data is sent in the form of packets using agreed protocols (e.g., TCP/IP).

==================================
2. What are the different types of networks? (LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN)
Local Area Network (LAN)
Covers a small geographic area like a home, office, or building.
Usually connected with Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi.
Example: Your home Wi-Fi network connecting your laptop, phone, and printer.

Wide Area Network (WAN)
Spans large geographic areas, like cities, countries, or even globally.
The internet is the largest example of a WAN.
WANs often use leased telecommunication lines or satellite links.

Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) - Larger than LAN but smaller than WAN.
Covers a city or campus. Often used by organizations with multiple buildings in a city.

Personal Area Network (PAN)
Very small network around a person.
Usually involves devices like smartphones, Bluetooth headphones, and laptops connected via Bluetooth or USB.

Wireless Networks (Wi-Fi)
Devices connect without cables.
Common in homes, cafes, and public spaces.
Uses radio waves to transmit data.

===================================
3. What is an IP address?
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical label assigned to every device connected to a computer network 
that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

Public IP Address:
Used on the wider internet, unique globally, assigned by your ISP.
Private IP Address:
Used within private networks (like your home LAN), not unique globally.

============================
4. What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?
Feature	         IPv4        	IPv6
Bit length	     32 bits	    128 bits
Address count  	~4.3 billion	~340 undecillion
NAT required	   Yes	         No - every device has its public ip
Built-in security	No	         Yes (IPsec)
Speed/Efficiency	Moderate	   More efficient
Uses ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Uses NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol)

What is IPsec? - IPsec stands for Internet Protocol Security.
It is a suite of protocols used to secure IP communications by:
Encrypting the data, authenticating the sender, Protecting the data from being tampered 

Confidentiality — It encrypts your data, so no one can read it during transmission.
Integrity — It ensures the data was not changed during transit.
Authentication — It confirms that the data came from a trusted source.

VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) — to securely connect remote users or sites.
Secure communications between data centers or cloud environments.
Site-to-site tunnels (e.g., AWS VPN uses IPsec under the hood).

===================================
5. What is a subnet mask?
A subnet mask is a number that helps divide an IP address into two parts:
Network portion — identifies the specific network.
Host portion — identifies the specific device (host) within that network.

It tells devices which part of the IP address refers to the network and which part refers to the individual device.
This helps routers and devices understand if another device is on the same local network (subnet) or 
if the data needs to be sent through a router to a different network.

The subnet mask looks similar to an IP address, for example: 255.255.255.0 - 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
Example:
IP Address: 192.168.1.10
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

This means:
Network part: 192.168.1
Host part: .10

AWS VPC and Subnet Masking Basics
In AWS, when you create a VPC, you assign it a CIDR block (a range of IP addresses), for example: 10.0.0.0/16
This /16 notation is CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) and tells you how many bits are for the network part.
/16 means the first 16 bits are the network portion (equivalent subnet mask: 255.255.0.0).
It defines which IP addresses belong to which subnet inside the VPC.
Helps AWS route traffic internally between instances in different subnets or route traffic outside the VPC.
Determines how many hosts (EC2 instances, etc.) can fit in each subnet.

===========================================
6. What is a MAC address?
A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC) in a device by manifacturer. 
When your device wants to send data in a local network:
It(router) uses ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to find the MAC address of the destination.
Data is then delivered using MAC addresses within the LAN.

MAC addresses are crucial for:
Ethernet and Wi-Fi communication
Network filtering
Access control (e.g., allowing only certain devices to connect)

Can it be changed?
Yes, it can be spoofed (changed temporarily using software), but the original MAC address is burned into the NIC at the factory.

what is NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol)?
Neighbor Discovery Protocol, is a protocol used in IPv6 networks to manage communication between devices on the same local network (link-local communication).
It replaces several functions from IPv4 protocols like:
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
ICMP Router Discovery
ICMP Redirect

DHCP (partially)
IPv4 vs IPv6 (with NDP):
Task	                IPv4 Uses	      IPv6 Uses
Find MAC address	    ARP	            NDP
Discover routers	    ICMP + manual 	NDP (RA messages)
Detect duplicate IPs	Not built-in	  NDP (DAD feature)
Assign IP address	    DHCP (mostly)	SLAAC via NDP
==============================

7. What is DNS and how does it work?
Domain Name System - hit domain name, it check for ip in cache, recursive resoler, root server, TLD server(.com,.in) , authoritative
DNS host recored - A ipv4, AAAA - ipv6. CNAME	Alias for another name

======================
8. What is DHCP? Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.
it is a network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network settings to devices (like laptops, phones, servers) when they connect to a network.
This is known as the DORA process:
Step	Name	      Description
1️⃣	  Discover	  Device broadcasts: “Is there a DHCP server?”
2️⃣	  Offer	      DHCP server replies: “Here's an IP you can use.”
3️⃣	  Request     Device says: “Yes, I’d like to use that IP.”
4️⃣	  Acknowledge	DHCP server confirms: “You're good to go!” and finalizes the assignment.

You connect your laptop to Wi-Fi.
The router (which acts as the DHCP server) gives your laptop:
IP: 192.168.1.45
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.1.1
DNS: 8.8.8.8

=========================

9. What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
Feature	          TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)	        UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
Connection	      Connection-oriented (requires a handshake)	Connectionless (no handshake)
Reliability	      Reliable – ensures all data is received,    Unreliable – no guarantee of delivery or order
Speed	            Slower (due to overhead for reliability)	  Faster (less overhead)
Data Integrity	  Checks for errors, retransmits lost packets	No error checking or retransmission
Use Case	        Used when accuracy is critical            	Used when speed is more important than reliability
Examples	        HTTP/HTTPS, SSH, FTP, SMTP	                DNS, VoIP, video streaming, online games

==============================
10. What are the OSI and TCP/IP models?
Layer No.	Name	          Description
7	        Application   	User apps like browsers, email, etc.
6       	Presentation	  Data formatting, encryption, compression
5	        Session	Manages sessions (open, close, sync)
4	        Transport	      Reliable delivery (TCP/UDP)
3       	Network	        IP addressing, routing (IP)
2       	Data Link	      MAC addresses, switches, Ethernet
1       	Physical	      Cables, NICs, bits-on-the-wire

TCP/IP Layer	Corresponds to OSI Layers	    Description
Application	  OSI 7, 6, 5	                  Web, email, FTP, DNS, etc.
Transport	    OSI 4	                        TCP or UDP
Internet	    OSI 3	                        IP addressing and routing
Network Access	OSI 2 and 1	                Physical hardware, MAC, Ethernet

"ATIN = Application, Transport, Internet, Network access"

============================

11. What are common network devices? (Router, Switch, Hub, Gateway)
Device	       Function / Purpose
Router	       Connects different networks, routes data packets between them, often between LAN and WAN or internet.
Switch	       Connects devices within the same local network (LAN), forwards data based on MAC addresses.
Hub	           Basic device that broadcasts incoming packets to all connected devices (mostly obsolete).
Modem	         Modulates and demodulates signals for internet access, connects home network to ISP.
Access Point (AP)	Provides wireless network access, connects Wi-Fi devices to wired network.
Firewall	     Filters incoming/outgoing traffic based on security rules, protects the network.
Gateway	       Acts as a bridge between two different networks or protocols. Often a router also functions as a gateway.
Repeater	     Amplifies or regenerates signals to extend network range.
Bridge	       Connects two LAN segments, filters traffic to reduce collisions.
Proxy Server	Intermediary between client and server, often for caching, filtering, or anonymity.
Load Balancer	Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers for reliability and performance.

hub alone cannot communicate with devices in another city.
Router:
Your home Wi-Fi router that connects your devices to the internet.
Gateway:
A company’s VoIP gateway converting phone calls into data packets over the internet, or a gateway connecting a private network to a cloud service that uses a different protocol.
==================

12. What is NAT (Network Address Translation)? Masking of private ip address
Type	       Description
Static NAT	 One-to-one mapping between a private IP and a public IP.
Dynamic NAT	 Maps a private IP to a public IP from a pool, dynamically.
PAT (Port Address Translation) or NAT Overload	Many private IPs share a single public IP but use different ports. Most common type used in home routers.
=====================

13. What is a firewall?
A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of security rules.
It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network untrusted external networks 
Traffic filtering: Allows or blocks traffic based on IP addresses, ports, protocols, or content.
Prevents unauthorized access: Stops hackers or malicious software from reaching your network.
Monitors network traffic: Keeps logs of traffic for auditing and detecting suspicious activity.
Controls access: Enforces rules about what kind of traffic can enter or leave the network.

========================

14. What is the difference between a hub, switch, and router?
========================
Intermediate Network Interview Questions
1. Explain how ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) works.
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a network protocol used to map a known IP address (Layer 3 address) 
to a MAC address (Layer 2 hardware address) on a local network.
How Does ARP Work?
Device needs to communicate with another device on the same local network (LAN) and knows the target's IP address but not its MAC address.
It broadcasts an ARP request packet to the local network asking:
"Who has IP address 192.168.1.10? Tell me your MAC address."
The device with the matching IP responds with an ARP reply, which contains its MAC address:
"I am 192.168.1.10, and my MAC is 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E."
The requester caches this MAC-IP mapping in its ARP table to use for future communications without sending another ARP request.
Now, the original device can send Ethernet frames directly to the MAC address.

========================

2. What is a VLAN and why is it used?
VLAN stands for Virtual Local Area Network.
It’s a way to create multiple separate logical networks within the same physical network infrastructure
How VLANs Work:
Each VLAN is identified by a VLAN ID (a number from 1 to 4094).
Switch ports are assigned to VLANs — devices connected to those ports belong to that VLAN.
VLANs create separate Layer 2 broadcast domains on the same physical switch.
Communication between VLANs requires a router or Layer 3 switch (inter-VLAN routing).

==========================
3. What is a VPN and how does it work?
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection (a "tunnel") over the internet between 
your device and a remote server or network.
It allows you to:
Safely access a private network (like your office network) from a public location.
Encrypt your internet traffic to protect against spying.
Hide your IP address and appear to browse from another location.

VPN Protocols
Some common VPN protocols include:
IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) — secure and used in site-to-site VPNs.
OpenVPN — open-source and widely used.
WireGuard — newer, faster, and simpler.
SSL/TLS VPN — often used for remote access over HTTPS.

Types of VPNS
Type	              Description
Remote Access VPN	  Lets individual users securely connect to a private network over the internet
Site-to-Site VPN	  Connects entire networks (e.g., two offices) over a secure internet tunnel
Client-to-Site VPN	Connects a user device (client) to a company network (similar to remote access)
Cloud VPN	          Used to connect on-premises networks to cloud environments like AWS or Azure

1. Site-to-Site VPN in AWS
This is used to connect your on-premises network to your AWS VPC securely over the internet.
🔧 Components Involved:
Customer Gateway (CGW): Represents your on-premises VPN device (e.g., Cisco/Juniper router).
Virtual Private Gateway (VGW): AWS-managed VPN concentrator attached to your VPC.
VPN Connection: The encrypted tunnel between the VGW and CGW.

📌 How It Works:
You define a Customer Gateway in AWS using your on-prem public IP and device settings.
You create a Virtual Private Gateway and attach it to your VPC.
Then you create a VPN Connection between the CGW and VGW.
AWS provides you with a configuration file to apply to your on-premises device.
After setup, your on-prem servers can communicate with AWS EC2s over a secure IPsec VPN tunnel.

AWS Client VPN
Used to allow remote users (like employees working from home) to securely connect to the AWS network from their laptops.

🔧 Components Involved:
Client VPN Endpoint: Managed by AWS, supports OpenVPN.
Authorization Rules: Specify which CIDR ranges a user can access.
Target Network Associations: The subnets in your VPC the VPN will route traffic to.
Client Configuration File (.ovpn): Used to connect from laptops using an OpenVPN-compatible client.

📌 How It Works:
Create a Client VPN Endpoint in AWS.
Associate it with one or more subnets in your VPC.
Set authorization rules and optionally integrate with Active Directory or IAM for user authentication.
Distribute the .ovpn file to users.
Users connect with a VPN client—traffic to AWS is encrypted and securely routed.

AWS Direct Connect (DX) is a dedicated, private network connection between your on-premises data center (or colocation facility) and AWS.
Unlike VPN, which goes over the public internet, Direct Connect provides a high-bandwidth, low-latency, and more secure path to AWS services.

==========================
4. What is port forwarding?
Port forwarding is a networking technique that allows external devices to access services on a private/internal network by 
forwarding traffic from a specific port on a public IP address to a device inside the private network. Example. enabling 22

Port Forwarding in AWS?
In AWS, port forwarding is typically handled by:
Security Groups (controls allowed ports)
Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) (routes traffic to EC2s on different ports)
NAT Gateways or Bastion Hosts (for SSH or RDP access to private instances)
==========================

5. What is the difference between a public IP and a private IP?
Public IP vs. Private IP
Feature	              Public IP	                                          Private IP
Scope	                Used on the Internet	                              Used within a private/internal network
Uniqueness	          Globally unique — no two devices can have the same	Locally unique — multiple networks can reuse them
Assigned By	          Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or AWS	          Automatically assigned by router/DHCP or manually
Example Ranges	      Anything not in private ranges	Reserved ranges:    Class A, Class B, Class C
                                                                          - 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
                                                                          - 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
                                                                          - 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
Accessible From Internet	✅ Yes	                                        ❌ No (without port forwarding or NAT)
Security	More exposed — needs firewall/protection	                      More secure — isolated from internet
Example:
Let’s say you have:A home Wi-Fi router with:
Public IP: 203.0.113.5 (assigned by your ISP)
Internal devices:
Laptop: 192.168.1.10
Phone: 192.168.1.11

Your laptop and phone use private IPs and access the internet through the router’s public IP using NAT (Network Address Translation).
=================================
6. What is the purpose of ICMP?
ICMP stands for Internet Control Message Protocol.
It is a network layer protocol used for sending error messages and operational information between devices, typically routers and hosts.
It’s not used to send data, like HTTP or FTP, but to report issues or perform diagnostics.
enabling tracerrot and ping - 22 in firwalrule , so that we will receive a error message, ping is a icmp tool

==================================

7. Explain the three-way TCP handshake.
Client                       Server
  | -------- SYN -------->   |
  |                         |
  | <------ SYN-ACK ------- |
  |                         |
  | -------- ACK -------->  |
  |                         |
Connection Established ✅

===================================
8. What are some common network topologies?

🔗 1. Bus Topology
Description: All devices are connected to a single central cable (the "bus").
Pros: Simple and inexpensive to set up.
Cons:A failure in the bus breaks the whole network. Poor performance under heavy load.
🖼️ Imagine Christmas lights wired in a single straight line — one break affects all.

🔁 2. Ring Topology, Description: Each device is connected to two others, forming a circular path.
Pros: Data flows in one direction, reducing collisions.
Cons: One break can take down the entire network (unless it's a dual ring).
🖼️ Like people sitting in a circle, passing a note in one direction.

⭐ 3. Star Topology (most common today)
Description: All devices are connected to a central device (like a switch or hub).
Pros: Easy to manage and troubleshoot. Failure of one device doesn’t affect others.
Cons:Central hub is a single point of failure.
🖼️ Think of a wheel with spokes — the center controls everything.

🕸️ 4. Mesh Topology
Description: Every device is connected to every other device (fully) or partially connected.
Pros: Highly reliable and fault-tolerant. Great performance.
Cons: Expensive and complex to manage.
🖼️ Like a spiderweb — multiple paths for the same data.

Topology	Reliability	Cost	  Scalability	Use Case Example
Bus	      Low	        Low	    Low	      Small temporary networks
Ring    	Medium	    Medium	Low	      Token Ring LANs (legacy)
Star    	High	      Medium	High     	Home/office networks
Mesh    	Very        High	  High	    Medium	Military, data centers
Tree    	High	      Medium	High	    Corporate networks
Hybrid	  Very High	  High	  Very High	Large enterprise systems

9. What is QoS (Quality of Service)?


===========================

10. Explain Load Balancing and how it works.

=============================
11. What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption in networks?
Feature	            Symmetric	                          Asymmetric
Keys used	          Same key for encrypt/decrypt	      Public + Private key pair
Speed	              🔸 Fast                     	     🔹 Slower
Security challenge	Key sharing is risky	              Easier key distribution (public key)
Use Cases	          VPNs, internal systems, bulk data	  SSL/TLS, email, authentication
Example Algorithms	AES, DES, RC4	                      RSA, ECC, DSA

Symmetric Encryption - Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. Both sender and receiver must share the same secret key beforehand.
Asymmetric Encryption - Uses a pair of keys:
Public key (shared with everyone)
Private key (kept secret by the owner)
Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key, and vice versa.
Use Case:
TLS/SSL (HTTPS), email encryption, SSH, digital signatures
===============================
12. What is the difference between unicast, multicast, and broadcast?
Unicast = one-to-one
Multicast = one-to-many (specific group)
Broadcast = one-to-all (everyone on the network)
============================
Advanced Network Interview Questions
1. What is BGP and how does it work?
Border Gateway Protocol - find best path for sending a data. -  it makes routing decisions based on paths, rules, and policies rather than just shortest distance.

2. Explain MPLS and its benefits.

3. How does DNS resolution happen step-by-step?

4. What are the differences between TCP congestion control algorithms?

5. Explain how SSL/TLS works.
Confidentiality: Data is encrypted, so attackers can’t read it.
Integrity: Data cannot be altered without detection.
Authentication: The server’s identity is verified, protecting against impersonation.
Client Hello - This message includes supported TLS versions, encryption algorithms (cipher suites), and a random number.
Server Hello - The server responds with its own “Hello,” choosing the TLS version and cipher suite from the client’s options.
The server also sends its digital certificate, which contains its public key and identity information, signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

Certificate Verification - The client checks the server’s certificate to confirm it’s valid and issued by a trusted CA.
This helps ensure you’re communicating with the legitimate server, not an impostor.

Key Exchange
The client and server securely agree on a shared secret key to encrypt further communication.
Depending on the cipher suite, this can happen via Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or by the client encrypting a “pre-master secret” with the server’s public key.

Session Keys Creation
Both client and server generate symmetric encryption keys from the shared secret.
Symmetric encryption is much faster for the actual data transfer.

Finished Messages
Both sides send a “Finished” message encrypted with the session key, proving that key exchange was successful.

Secure Communication Begins
Now, all data between client and server is encrypted and secure from eavesdropping or tampering.
