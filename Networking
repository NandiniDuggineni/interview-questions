Basic Network Interview Questions

1. What is a computer network?
A computer network is a collection of two or more computers and other devices that are connected together to share resources, exchange data, 
and communicate with each other. These connections can be made using physical cables (like Ethernet) or wireless technologies (like Wi-Fi).
Key points:
Purpose: To enable communication and resource sharing (like files, printers, internet access).
Types: Can be small (like a home network) or large (like the internet).
Components: Includes computers, routers, switches, servers, and other devices.
Communication: Data is sent in the form of packets using agreed protocols (e.g., TCP/IP).

==================================

2. What are the different types of networks? (LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN)
Local Area Network (LAN)
Covers a small geographic area like a home, office, or building.
Usually connected with Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi.
Example: Your home Wi-Fi network connecting your laptop, phone, and printer.

Wide Area Network (WAN)
Spans large geographic areas, like cities, countries, or even globally.
The internet is the largest example of a WAN.
WANs often use leased telecommunication lines or satellite links.

Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) - Larger than LAN but smaller than WAN.
Covers a city or campus. Often used by organizations with multiple buildings in a city.

Personal Area Network (PAN)
Very small network around a person.
Usually involves devices like smartphones, Bluetooth headphones, and laptops connected via Bluetooth or USB.

Wireless Networks (Wi-Fi)
Devices connect without cables.
Common in homes, cafes, and public spaces.
Uses radio waves to transmit data.

===================================

3. What is an IP address?
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical label assigned to every device connected to a computer network 
that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

Public IP Address:
Used on the wider internet, unique globally, assigned by your ISP.
Private IP Address:
Used within private networks (like your home LAN), not unique globally.

============================

4. What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?
Feature	         IPv4        	IPv6
Bit length	     32 bits	    128 bits
Address count  	~4.3 billion	~340 undecillion
NAT required	   Yes	         No - every device has its public ip
Built-in security	No	         Yes (IPsec)
Speed/Efficiency	Moderate	   More efficient
Uses ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Uses NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol)

What is IPsec? - IPsec stands for Internet Protocol Security.
It is a suite of protocols used to secure IP communications by:
Encrypting the data, authenticating the sender, Protecting the data from being tampered 

Confidentiality — It encrypts your data, so no one can read it during transmission.
Integrity — It ensures the data was not changed during transit.
Authentication — It confirms that the data came from a trusted source.

VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) — to securely connect remote users or sites.
Secure communications between data centers or cloud environments.
Site-to-site tunnels (e.g., AWS VPN uses IPsec under the hood).
====================

5. What is a subnet mask?
A subnet mask is a number that helps divide an IP address into two parts:
Network portion — identifies the specific network.
Host portion — identifies the specific device (host) within that network.

It tells devices which part of the IP address refers to the network and which part refers to the individual device.
This helps routers and devices understand if another device is on the same local network (subnet) or 
if the data needs to be sent through a router to a different network.

The subnet mask looks similar to an IP address, for example: 255.255.255.0 - 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
Example:
IP Address: 192.168.1.10
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

This means:
Network part: 192.168.1
Host part: .10

AWS VPC and Subnet Masking Basics
In AWS, when you create a VPC, you assign it a CIDR block (a range of IP addresses), for example: 10.0.0.0/16
This /16 notation is CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) and tells you how many bits are for the network part.
/16 means the first 16 bits are the network portion (equivalent subnet mask: 255.255.0.0).
It defines which IP addresses belong to which subnet inside the VPC.
Helps AWS route traffic internally between instances in different subnets or route traffic outside the VPC.
Determines how many hosts (EC2 instances, etc.) can fit in each subnet.
===========================================

6. What is a MAC address?
A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC) in a device by manifacturer. 
When your device wants to send data in a local network:
It(router) uses ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to find the MAC address of the destination.
Data is then delivered using MAC addresses within the LAN.

MAC addresses are crucial for:
Ethernet and Wi-Fi communication
Network filtering
Access control (e.g., allowing only certain devices to connect)

Can it be changed?
Yes, it can be spoofed (changed temporarily using software), but the original MAC address is burned into the NIC at the factory.
