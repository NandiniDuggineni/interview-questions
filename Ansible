what is a configuration management tool or Ansible? 
it's an open source configuration management tool. it also helps to simplify complex problems and to automate repetitive work, which is faster and efficient. 

2. Difference between ansible and other tools.
Ansible is agent less. Yaml syntax. 

3. what is ansible plabook.
its yaml file, it has set of instruction which has to exicute om managed nodes. we can automate complex management like configuration management or deploying application. 

4. Inventory in Ansible?
It has a set of info about managed nodes and group them. iventory -i

5. concept of idempotence?
it generally maintains the state of the system. it check current state wth desired state.

6. Ansible roles?
to reduce the complexity of playbook, or if want to reuse then we will go with role. there is a directory strcture it follows.

7. Adhoc commands and playbook
adhoc is for one time task, playbook is a kind of automating repetative task. we want to excute multiple time.

8. How do you handle sensitive data?
Ansible has Ansible Vault, Env variable or external vault Harshi corp vault

9. purpose of ansible galaxy?
It is a hub, find, share, and reuse roles playbook, and these can be reused whenever needed. It's kind of a centralized repository for community content.

10. what is ansible tower?
It's a GUI web-based tool. It has a dashboard. It has RBAC (role-based access control). Schedule jobs. centralize login macanizium. We can remove dependencies so anyone can execute.
Ansible credential vault we can use in playbook.

11. How to debug?
verbose -vvvv it gives detailed output. Also, we can use a dry run. Asible-playbook playbookname -C

12. Ansible facts.
Info about managed nodes is collected by Ansible about managed nodes. like which os, IP address, hardware, and custom info used by managed nodes. ex: we want to run the playbook in Windows

13. Handling error
it support error handling, ignore_errors, failed_when, and block statements. Log error messages and take appropriate actions based on the output.

14. What is RBAC?
as an admin, we can define granular permissions to different users/teams. Only authorized users can log in, mainly to enhance security. 

15. Integrate Ansible with other tools?
plugins, API, and webhooks. Git, jenkins and Prometheus, and graphana. 


Advanced interview questions.
1. what are ansible vault? how they manage sensitive data?
they encrypt (passwords, ssh keys or any api's) data. we can use ansible-vault to create encrypted data and reference it in a playbook using --ask-vault-pass.
also we can store vault pass in the file and we can reference then in the playbook. 

2. what are ansible collections?
these are simply some one curated collection like role modules, playbook and those distributed through Ansible Galaxy and also private repo. 
Unlike role, it allows versioning it also dependency management and distribution if collections across projects.

3. how we can implement multienvironment deployment using ansible.
we can make use of inventory file for defining different env ( dev, prepod and prod). Dynamic inventory plugins and group variables for flexible environment management. 
variables and configuration settings to customise these env, 

4. Strategies to test playbooks and roles?
we have Ansible tools like AnsibleLint (systax error), Molecule automates the testing across different platforms using docker or vagrant. 
test infra used to perform integration testing by verifying expected system state changes. 

5. How to we implemet blue-green ?
playbook can automate, two identical environments and switch traffic between those using 

6. How to handle rolling updates and zero down time deployments?

Senario based 
ðŸ”¹ Question 1: You need to provision a new server instance on AWS with Ansible. How would you approach this task?
The playbook would specify the desired instance type, region, security group and other configuration. also, tags and ssh key pairs

ðŸ”¹ Question 2: You have multiple web servers running Apache, and you need to ensure that a specific configuration file is consistent across all servers. How would you achieve this with Ansible?
I would create ansible role that has tasks template the configuration file with variables, distribute to all webservers and maintain desired state. restart services when ever needed.

ðŸ”¹ Question 3: Your team is deploying a new version of a web application across multiple servers. How would you use Ansible to automate the deployment process?
ansible playbook that pulls the latest version of the application from version control & copy it to the target server and perform necessary configuration updates.
playbook/role tasks would used to stop the existing application & deploy new version and start the updated application ensuring smooth and consistent deployment process.

ðŸ”¹ Question 4: You want to perform rolling updates to a group of servers without causing downtime. How would you implement this using Ansible?
Ansible serial keyword and setting the desired number or percentage to update number of servers simultaneously. Ansible would update one by one or small batche ensuring application 
ramins available though out the update process.

ðŸ”¹ Question 5: You have a load balancer that needs to be updated with the IP addresses of newly provisioned servers. How would you automate this task with Ansible?
Ansible playbook that dynamically retrive ip address of the new servers and updates the load balancer configuration accordingly.
playbook would use ansible ec2_instance_facts module to gather information about the provisined instance and then use module to update load balancer configuration.

ðŸ”¹ Question 6: Your organization requires regular security patching of servers. How would you automate the process using Ansible?
play book that uses apt or yum module to install security updates on the machines. Playbook specify the necessary package to be updated and would run periodically using Ansible shceduling 
or integrated with cicd pipepline to ensure timely oatching of servers. 

ðŸ”¹ Question 7: You need to automate the backup of a MySQL database running on multiple servers. How would you accomplish this with Ansible?
Ansible playbook that connects each db server execute a mysql dump command to create a backup of data base and trasfer a backup fikes to designated backup server or storage location.
This playbook would be scheduled to run regulalry to ensure that database backups are performed consistently.

ðŸ”¹ Question 8: In the event of a disaster, you need to restore a critical application to a previous state using Ansible. How would you implement this?
Ansible playbook that retrives the necessary configuration files from backup storage and deployes them to the target servers. This playbook would also include tasks to restore
database backups and other dependencies ensuing that the application is fully recovered to its pervious state.

ðŸ”¹ Question 9: You have separate development, staging, and production environments, each with different configuration settings. How would you manage deployments across these environments using Ansible?
in Ansible inventory we can define separate groups for each environment and specofi environment specific variables in playbooks. 
by parametarizing the task and leveraging the dynamic inventory, i can ensure that deployment are tailored to each env requirement while maintaining the consistency accross env.
