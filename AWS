Stickey session usually maintain the session consistency for all the queries of a particular customer. 
1. in the target group of ALB we have a session stickiness feature, and we can provide appropriate time. 1 sec to 7 days. 
but we should avoid giving long time, because it causes an un even loads. ecommerce chat - 30 min, online forms - 15min, short task - 5-15 min.

1. I would adjust cool down period to delay scale in action, giving instance more time to process requ.

ðŸ”¹ Question 15: Your application has varying load levels in different regions. How would you configure Auto Scaling for this setup?
1. i would use different scaling groups in each region to handle region-specific loads independently. 
2. use AWS global accelerator or orute 53 with latency based routing to distribute traffic.
