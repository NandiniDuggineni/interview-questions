Senario based 

ðŸ”¹ Question 1: You are tasked with designing a scalable web application on AWS to handle fluctuating traffic. 
What services and architecture would you use to ensure both availability and cost-efficiency?

ðŸ”¹ Question 2: Your application needs to process large volumes of data and convert it into various formats for downstream services. What AWS services would you use to automate and scale this process?
ðŸ”¹ Question 3: Your organization has decided to use AWS for disaster recovery but wants to minimize costs. What disaster recovery architecture would you recommend?
ðŸ”¹ Question 4: You need to ensure secure and compliant data transfer between your on-premises data center and AWS. What would you recommend?
ðŸ”¹ Question 5: You are managing a microservices-based application that is experiencing latency due to high database load. How would you optimize the architecture?
ðŸ”¹ Question 6: You have a critical application that cannot tolerate any downtime. How would you architect this solution on AWS to achieve high availability?
ðŸ”¹ Question 7: Your application requires secure storage of sensitive customer data, with auditing and monitoring of all access attempts. What would you do?
ðŸ”¹ Question 8: Your team needs a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automatically deploy applications in AWS. How would you set it up?
ðŸ”¹ Question 9: Your web application experiences a large number of requests from a particular geographical region causing latency. How would you improve performance for users in that region?
ðŸ”¹ Question 10: You need to implement fine-grained access control for a growing number of users accessing an AWS S3 bucket. How would you design this?
ðŸ”¹ Question 11: Your application is built on containers, and you need a solution that allows automatic scaling of containers without managing underlying servers. What AWS service would you recommend?
ðŸ”¹ Question 12: You need to archive data that is rarely accessed but must be retained for compliance reasons. How would you store this data in AWS?
ðŸ”¹ Question 13: You need to optimize costs for a fleet of EC2 instances that run non-critical workloads during business hours. How can you achieve cost savings without sacrificing performance?
ðŸ”¹ Question 14: Your application handles sensitive data, and you need to ensure encryption of data in transit and at rest. How would you architect this solution on AWS?
ðŸ”¹ Question 15: You need to migrate a large database from your on-premises environment to AWS with minimal downtime. How would you achieve this?
