Senario based 

ðŸ”¹ Question 1: You are tasked with designing a scalable web application on AWS to handle fluctuating traffic. 
What services and architecture would you use to ensure both availability and cost-efficiency?
1. High availability - we can deploy application in multi AZ deployment
2. high sclable - we have auto scaling groups 
3. ELD: To distribute the load between servers.
4. Cost saving - store static content like images, CSS, js files in Amazon s3 and use cloud formation cdn servervice for distribution.
5. use: Amazon RDS or Aurora with multi-AZ deployments for high availability of the application. 
6. Implement route 53 for DNS resolution and to perform health checks on server for availability.

ðŸ”¹ Question 2: Your application needs to process large volumes of data and convert it into various formats for downstream services. 
What AWS services would you use to automate and scale this process?
1. Store the data in amazon s3. 
2. Use s3 event notification to trigger lamda function as soon as obejct uploaded in the bucket. 
3. Lamda will process the data.
4. we can slso use SQS for queing and sns for notification.
5. if we need parallel execution, use AWS batch processing.
6. Finally store the processed data in S3 or warehouse like redshift


ðŸ”¹ Question 3: Your organization has decided to use AWS for disaster recovery but wants to minimize costs. 
What disaster recovery architecture would you recommend?
1. Use the poilot light stratogy- menas only run the required resoucre like ami, database
2. Configure the cloud formation template and auto scaling for resource creation.
3. Use route 53 for failover
4. take the backup of ami and store it in s3

ðŸ”¹ Question 4: You need to ensure secure and compliant data transfer between your on-premises data center and AWS. What would you recommend?
1. Use AWS direct connect 
2. or AWS site to site VPN
3. Use SSL/TLS CERTIFICATION ( CLOUD FRONT, ROUTE 53, RDS) TO encrypt data during transit
4. to safe the at rest use KMS key, server side encryption and client side enkryption.
5. Enforce strict IAM policy and implement least privilege access and roles 

ðŸ”¹ Question 5: You are managing a microservices-based application that is experiencing latency due to high database load. 
How would you optimize the architecture?
1. high database load means read write operation on the database is high.
2. for read operation - use read replica ( rds rr, aurora read replica)
3. use AWS X-Ray to trace the request and check which services responding slow
4. for write it suggested to use dynamodb for high write thorught.

ðŸ”¹ Question 6: You have a critical application that cannot tolerate any downtime. How would you architect this solution on AWS 
to achieve high availability?
1. Use multi-az, ELB, Auto scaling, RDS-Multi AZ, Route 53 (latency based)
2. critical work loads use reservered or spot instance.
3. store obeject replication in s3 it will sore the data in multiple availability zones.

ðŸ”¹ Question 7: Your application requires secure storage of sensitive customer data, 
with auditing and monitoring of all access attempts. What would you do?
1. store in s3, 
2. Enable s3 bucket policies and acls
3. use KMS encryption, server side and client side, aes 256
4. data at transit ssl.tls.
5. oeject lock enabled (immutability)
6. access logs and guard duty 
7. cloud trail log

ðŸ”¹ Question 8: Your team needs a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automatically deploy applications in AWS. 
How would you set it up?
1, code pipeline ( to archestrate between version control (git) + cloud build)
2. code build ( to build, test, scan )
3, code deploy ( to deploy eks, ebs, ec2)
4. cloud watch monitoring 

ðŸ”¹ Question 9: Your web application experiences a large number of requests from a particular geographical region causing latency. 
How would you improve performance for users in that region?
1. use cloud front (cdn) service to cache the data on edge location
2. use route 53 geo routing technice to trasfer the data.

ðŸ”¹ Question 10: You need to implement fine-grained access control for a growing number of users accessing an AWS S3 bucket. 
How would you design this?
1. enforce iam plicies and roles and implement least privilages access
2. use bucket policies, acls.
3. Access logs for unauthorized access, also apply guard duty
4. use awscognito for user authentication

ðŸ”¹ Question 11: Your application is built on containers, and you need a solution that allows automatic scaling of containers without 
managing underlying servers. What AWS service would you recommend?
1. ecs, EKS FARGATS
2. and it autoscale container instance based on requirement set

ðŸ”¹ Question 12: You need to archive data that is rarely accessed but must be retained for compliance reasons. 
How would you store this data in AWS?
1. Use S3 life cycle plicy to move less frequent access data to glacier 
2. also we can enforce retntion policy for governce mode ( authorized person can delete) and complaince mode (can't delete until retention over)
3. use vault lock at glacier

ðŸ”¹ Question 13: You need to optimize costs for a fleet of EC2 instances that run non-critical workloads during business hours.
How can you achieve cost savings without sacrificing performance?
1. critical work load use reservered instance or spot instance
2. for non critical workloads use spot instance
3. use auto scaling group to scale down the resources

ðŸ”¹ Question 14: Your application handles sensitive data, and you need to ensure encryption of data in transit and at rest. How would you architect this solution on AWS?
ðŸ”¹ Question 15: You need to migrate a large database from your on-premises environment to AWS with minimal downtime. How would you achieve this?
1. use aws database migration service, for db, for application aws migration hub or application migration
2. it replicate the data between source and destination
3. or use snow ball for larger data sets
