senario.

ðŸ”¹ Question 1: You have been tasked with optimizing a Grafana dashboard that is experiencing slow loading times. How would you approach diagnosing and resolving performance issues?
begin by analyzing the dashboard query and visualization to identify any insufficient queries or resource-intensive panels.
I would optimize the query by reducing the time range, limiting the number of data points returned and optimizing data base index.
Additionally, i would review the dashboard layout and consider consolidating panelor using caching mechanisms to improve performance.

ðŸ”¹ Question 2: A critical metric in your monitoring system has exceeded a predefined threshold, triggering an alert. How would you configure Grafana to send notifications to the appropriate stakeholders?
Use alerting rules in Grafana to monitor relevant metrics and define conditions for triggering alerts (CPU, meme )
also specify notification channel, email/slack/pagerduty.
set alert notation om dashboardfor the visibility on active alerts.

ðŸ”¹ Question 3: You need to integrate a new data source into Grafana to visualize metrics from an external monitoring system. How would you configure Grafana to fetch data from this data source?
i would install and configure the appropriate data source plugin in Grafana to connect to the external monitoring system.
I would specify connection details such as endpoint URL, authentication credentials, and query parameters.
once the data source is configured, i would create dashboard and panels to visualize the metrics retrived from the data source.

ðŸ”¹ Question 4: Your organization requires a highly available Grafana deployment to ensure uninterrupted access to monitoring dashboards. How would you design and implement a high availability setup for Grafana?
I would deploy multiple instances of Graohana behind load balancer to distribute traffic and ensure redundancy.
I would configure session affinity to maintain user sessions across grphana instance and use shared storage for storing session data and dashboard configuration. 
Additionally, i would set up database replication and clustering to ensure data consistency and fault tolerance.

ðŸ”¹ Question 5: Users are experiencing issues accessing Grafana dashboards embedded in external websites due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions. How would you configure Grafana to allow cross-origin requests?
I would configure CORS(cross-origin resource sharing) settings to allow requests from specific domain or origins using allow_origin config option
I would specify domains or origins that  are  permitted to access Grafana resource, ensuring cross-origin req are allowed without compramising security.

ðŸ”¹ Question 6: Your organization needs to define data retention policies for Grafana to manage storage costs and comply with regulatory requirements. How would you configure data retention policies in Grafana?
Configure data retention policies to specify how long metric data should be retained before automatically deleting or archiving. 
I would define the retention period based on the business requirement. complain about regulations & storage capacity constraints.
Additionally, data pruning mechanisms to regularly clean up expired data and optimize storage.

ðŸ”¹ Question 7: Your organization uses LDAP for centralized user authentication. How would you configure Grafana to authenticate users against an LDAP directory?
Graphana's LADP setting to connect to the LADP directory and authenticate users using LADP credentials.
need to provide LADP server info and search base for query information. 
map LDAP attributes to Graphana user properties to synchronize user accounts and permissions.

ðŸ”¹ Question 8: You need to create a dynamic Grafana dashboard that allows users to select different time ranges and filter data based on specific criteria. How would you implement dashboard templating in Grafana?
I would use Graphana dashboard templating feature to define a variable that users can interact with to dynamically change dashboard content.
would create template variable for time ranges, filters or other parameters and bind them to query parameters or  panel options.
This would allow users to customize the dashboard view based on their requirements.

ðŸ”¹ Question 9: Your organization requires a custom visualization plugin for Grafana to display proprietary data sources. How would you develop and integrate a custom plugin into Grafana?
would develop a custom visualization plugin using Graphana's plugin development framework and libraries. 
I would implement the desired visualization logic, including data fetching, rendering and interaction handling.
once the plugin is developed, I would package it as graphana plugin and install it into the grafana instance.
users can then use the custom visualize data from proprietary sources.

ðŸ”¹ Question 10: You need to share Grafana dashboards with external stakeholders who do not have access to the Grafana instance. How would you share and embed Grafana dashboards in external websites or portals?
i would use dashboard sharing and embedding features to generate shareable links or embed codes for dashboard.
i would configure access permission to specify whether viewrs can only view or also edit the dashboard.
users can then access the shared dashboard via the generated link or embed it into external websites or portals using the provided embed code.

ðŸ”¹ Question 11: You need to configure advanced alerting rules in Grafana to detect complex patterns or anomalies in metric data. How would you define and configure advanced alerting rules?
I would use Grafana's advanced alerting features, such as alerting threshold, anomalies and detection and complex query condition to define
Alerting rules that detect specific patterns or anomalies in metric data. 
I would configure alerting conditions based on statistical analysis, trend detection or machine learning algorithm to trigger alerts wne
predefined criteria are  met.

ðŸ”¹ Question 12: Your team needs to add custom annotations to Grafana dashboards to mark important events or changes. How would you create and manage custom annotations in Grafana?
 grafanas custom annotation feature to add annotation to the dashboard, specifying relevant metadata such as event time stamps, descriptions and tags
 I would create annotations manually or programmatically using Grafana's HTTP API or an external data source.           
Annotations can provide valuable context and visibility into events or changes that impact monitoring and analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Question 13: Your organization uses Grafana to visualize metrics from remote data sources located in different geographical regions. How would you configure Grafana to fetch data from remote data sources efficiently?
I would configure Grafana's data source settings to optimize data retrieval and minimize latency when fetching data from remote.
This may involve deploying Grafana instance closer to the remote data source, leveraging a caching mechanism, or optimizing
network routes to reduce data transfer times.
Additionally, I would monitor and analyze data retrieval performance to identify and address any bottlenecks or latency issues.

ðŸ”¹ Question 14: Your organization requires granular access control for Grafana to enforce security policies and restrict access to sensitive data. How would you configure role-based access control (RBAC) in Grafana?
Configure RBAC settings to define role with specific permissions for users and groups.
I would assign roles to users based on thier responsibilities and access requirements, controlling access to data sources, dashboard,
folders and organization settings.
RBAC enables organizzational to enforce security complains with data privacy regulations

ðŸ”¹ Question 15: You need to visualize data from multiple data sources in a single Grafana dashboard to correlate metrics and analyze trends. How would you perform cross-data source queries in Grafana?
I would use grafanas cross-data source querying feature to fetch and merge data from multiple data source in a signals query
i would configure data source overrides to specify which data source to query and how to merge the results
This allows users to create unified dashboards that combine data from difference source for comprehensive monitoring and analysis
