ðŸ”¹ Question 1: What is AWS RDS?
1. RDS is a managed relational databse service that simplifies data base setup, operation and scaling. 
2. it supports various databse engines, including MySQl, PostgressSQL, oracle and sql, Maria db

ðŸ”¹ Question 2: How does AWS RDS handle backups?
1. RDS we can configure daily full backup and also transition logs for point in time recovery.

ðŸ”¹ Question 3: Can you change the DB instance class of a running RDS instance?
Yes, you can modify db instance class of a running RDS instance to scale it vertically for more cpu, memory or storage capacity 

ðŸ”¹ Question 4: What is Multi-AZ deployment in RDS?
We maintain stand by instance in different availability zones for high availability. 
if primary instance fail, traffic is automatically switched to the standby instance.

ðŸ”¹ Question 5: How is data encrypted in AWS RDS?
We can encrypt data at rest using KMS.
1. u can encrypt at the time of db creation or else encrypt already created unencrypted db by taking snapshot and restored with encryption. with kMS ARN or KMS ID. using command line

ðŸ”¹ Question 6: What is the purpose of Read Replicas in RDS?
those improve the read scalability. To offload the traffic from primary instance, we can create and use read heavy work loads. 

ðŸ”¹ Question 7: How can you monitor RDS performance?
using cloud watch metric we can monitor the database performence. 
Additinally we can enable enhanced monitoring to gether OS-level metrics and you can use databse logs for more detailed analysis. 

ðŸ”¹ Question 8: Can you install custom software on an RDS instance?
No, because it aws managed service. we can only use which supports db engine.

ðŸ”¹ Question 9: What is the purpose of parameter groups in RDS?
it allows to tune the performance, enable feature and adjust behaviour according to your specific requirement. 

ðŸ”¹ Question 10: How can you scale the storage capacity of an RDS instance?
modify storage settings to scale instance either initail or already existing instance. 


=================DynamoDB============================

ðŸ”¹ Question 1: What is Amazon DynamoDB?
No Sql DB, high perofrmence, scalability and easy to use. 

ðŸ”¹ Question 2: How does DynamoDB ensure high availability and fault tolerance?
Multi AZ replication, Each write is synchronously replicated to ensure durability.

ðŸ”¹ Question 3: What are the key components of DynamoDB?
tables, Item ( record ) and attribute ( field ) and primary key 

ðŸ”¹ Question 4: What is the difference between a primary key and a secondary index in DynamoDB?
secondary index allow you to query attributes other than the index. primary key is unique attribute - like employee id.

ðŸ”¹ Question 5: How does DynamoDB handle read and write capacity units?
provision read and write trhoughput it uses. and these defined based on the workload.

ðŸ”¹ Question 6: Can you change the provisioned throughput settings of a DynamoDB table after it's created?
yes,

ðŸ”¹ Question 7: What is the purpose of DynamoDB Streams?
it captures the changes to the items in the table and allow capturing real time processing. 

ðŸ”¹ Question 8: How does DynamoDB handle consistency and durability?
it provide strong consistency for read write operations with in single region. durability across multi az

ðŸ”¹ Question 9: What is the difference between On-Demand and Provisioned Capacity in DynamoDB?
provision require to provide read write capacity units in advance and is suitable for predictable workloads
on deamd - pay per req and suitable for unpredictable work loads.

ðŸ”¹ Question 10: How can you optimize queries in DynamoDB?
Desing the table based on the access pattern and appropriate index patterns and levarage feat
ure like projection expression to retrive only the necessary attributes.
